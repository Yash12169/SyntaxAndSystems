# Why Next.js Should Be Your Go-to JavaScript Framework

In the ever-evolving world of web development, choosing the right framework can be a daunting task. There are several options out there, each with its unique advantages. Next.js, a React-based framework, has emerged as one of the most popular choices for developers, offering features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes out of the box.

### Key Features of Next.js

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Next.js allows you to build SEO-friendly pages by rendering content on the server before it reaches the browser.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** You can pre-render pages at build time, which makes it perfect for static websites.
- **API Routes:** Next.js lets you create API endpoints directly within your application, reducing the need for a separate backend.

### Conclusion

With its rich feature set and seamless integration with React, Next.js is a top choice for developers looking to build modern, high-performance web applications.
